This is the coding project of my second semester of bachelor at EPFL.
The idea is to code basic physical objects like a ball, a pendulum, a box... They can interact in accordance to the laws of mechanics.

To launch the general program, you need to specify in the "all" line of the Makefile in the general folder which executable to run, and then execute make in the terminal.
For the graphical interface, run qmake followed by make in the terminal, and then execute the file named launch_project.
For the text-based interface, run qmake followed by make in the terminal, and then execute the file named launch_text.

The project has been built in a way that is both natural and creative, and the guidelines have generally been followed while integrating my own ideas in a balanced manner.
Enjoy using it!
